find minecraft usernames

This script includes usernames which may not be actually available. This is because of an issue with Mojang's system where many deleted accounts' old usernames are not freed up.

The output will include usernames that you're not allowed to use, as they cannot be differentiated from allowed ones. For example usernames containing rude words.
